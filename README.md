# The-Pizza-Task
 ## Task description
Let’s imagine you want to start a new pizza delivery business. Please create a small web application for online pizza ordering. The idea is to make a non-existing service where assumed clients can choose a pizza, put it into a cart
and make an order.

## Requirements
- The menu page should contain at least 8 pizzas
- The menu page should contain at least 8 pizzas
- Login is not required but could be available for checking the history of orders
- Your clients should be able to choose pizzas directly from the menu
- You can decide what else you want in the menu
- Adding a description for each pizza would be a nice decision
- Don’t proceed to the payment page. The last action from a client will be filling in the order form (address,
name, surname, etc.) to get a confirmation that the order has been received
- A client should be able to put several pizzas into cart, and the quantity must be defined both while
outside the cart and in the cart
- Total price of each order must be calculated and shown in euros and in dollars
- Don’t forget to add delivery costs to the final bill
